### How to:

- All tasks should be done independently
- Cheating is punished by zeroing points
- Each lab has a **hard deadline** in `README.md` file in the relevant folder
- Each your script could be satisfied PEP8 style guide. Each error coming from procedure
```
$ pycodestyle --first <script_name>.py
```
will be punished by one point from total points!
- Each lab folder with your solutions and tests could be zipped in archive like this
```
name = 'Name'
surname = 'Surname'
group_id = 161

lab_id = 0

zipped_dir = f'lab{lab_id}_{name}_{surname}_{group_id}.zip'
# 'lab0_Name_Surname_161.zip'
mail_topic = f'lab{lab_id}_{name}_{surname}_{group_id}'
# 'lab0_Name_Surname_161'
```
- Each lab archive could be emailed to the `lingvo-python-ml@yandex.ru` with topic `mail_topic` until hard deadline!
- Each submission after deadline would be verified with 0/10+ points. But you will have positive feedback! ;)
